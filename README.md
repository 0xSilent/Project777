# Realms: Fantasy (Project 777)
## Deep in the 'Verse...
A ringworld spins around a standard yellow-orange star. Not a titanic ringworld that encircles the whole star, but a more mundane one. It is comprised of 777 plates each 6000 km wide and long. It only has a dameter of 1.48 million kilometers, but it has an area equivalent to 55 Earths.

It is maintained (ruled) by the Seven, a group of cosmically powered AIs, that initially seeded the ring with life so that they could play as gods. Unfortunately their first experiment didn't end well. The Cataclysm left most plates devoid of life, but the Seven have decided to try again.

You are one of their proxies, given dominion over one (or a number) of plates. While the land is established, the rest is your canvas - you will shape its features, creatures, people and it's future.

The goal of this project is to create the most interesting fantasy world that you can. There is no PvP, focus on creative world building.
